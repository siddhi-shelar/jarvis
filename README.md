Chatbot using OpenRouter API
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a conversational AI chatbot using the OpenRouter API inside a Google Colab notebook. The chatbot allows real-time interaction with users, answering general knowledge questions, providing information, recipes, and more.

The chatbot is powered by large language models (LLMs) such as openai/gpt-3.5-turbo, but the model can be changed to others available on OpenRouter (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA, etc.).
